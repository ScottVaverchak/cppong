# TO DO TODO

* Graphics 
    * Shadow for ball is not working since we would need to change the pixel values
        * This would be eaiser with shaders
        * Another option is to create a second spritesheet that is tinted at startup
            * Spritesheet struct could have another Texture for "shadow"
* Basic Animations
    * Curves based animations for:
        * Fade
        * Zoom 
* Basic AI 
* Start screen
* Multiplatyer
    * Option for start screen
* Switch to OpenGL for rendering
* GameState Update
    * "GameState" for game
    * Make use of animations 
    * Implement States:
        * PlayerScored
            * Animation heavy "Player X scored!"
* Sounds 
    * Beeps
    * Boops
    * Bops
* Physics engine
    * Ground up physics engine
